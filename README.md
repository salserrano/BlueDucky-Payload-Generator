# BlueDucky Payload Generator Ver 1.1 beta (Android) ðŸ¦†

This is a simple URL payload generator for [pentestfunctions's BlueDucky](https://github.com/pentestfunctions/BlueDucky).

The script will create a "Generated Payloads" folder and output the text file there. Once generated, move the payloads file into the "payloads" folder of BlueDucky.

I included a Rickroll payload as an example.

*** ***The generated scripts have been tested on a Samsung device. For other Android brands, there is no guarantee that the payload will work.*** ***	

## Discoveries I Made with Samsung Bluetooth Shortcuts:
- I found that the fastest way to open any link is to use Android's built-in Google app. By typing the URL into the Google app search bar, the Google app automatically opens the URL with the device's default browser or any installed app that supports the link. This means that with just a URL, an app can be opened, assuming these apps are configured to "open supported links" in their app settings. For example, the YouTube app automatically opens when a YouTube URL is entered.
- For regular browser links that don't pertain to installed apps, I recommend setting Chrome as the default browser for opening these links.

Note:
- The output payload text file itself should work. Any issues, such as technical errors, should be reported by opening an issue in the [main BlueDucky repository](https://github.com/pentestfunctions/BlueDucky/issues).
- The commands execute quickly and work well if the phone is fast enough to open apps promptly. If the phone is slow and takes too long to open apps, it might miss the chance to type the link.
- Possible future updates: Consider developing more advanced payloads beyond URL input.
