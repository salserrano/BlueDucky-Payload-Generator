# BlueDucky Payload Generator Ver 1.0 (Android) ðŸ¦†

This is a simple payload generator for [pentestfunctions's BlueDucky](https://github.com/pentestfunctions/BlueDucky).

Once generated, move the payload file into the payload folder of BlueDucky.

Also included an rickroll payload as example.

Generated scripts has been tested on a Samsung device. For other andriod brands, not sure if payload would work.

Discoveries I found with the BlueDucky:
I found that the fastest way to open a youtube video is to use android built google app. By typing in the youtube link, the Google app automatically plays the video via Youtube app(this assumes the Youtube app is configured to open default links).
