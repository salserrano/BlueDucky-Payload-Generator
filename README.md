# BlueDucky Payload Generator Ver 1.0 beta (Android) ðŸ¦†

This is a simple payload generator for [pentestfunctions's BlueDucky](https://github.com/pentestfunctions/BlueDucky).

The script will create a "Generated Payloads" folder and output the text file there. Once generated, move the payload file into the payload folder of BlueDucky.

I included a rickroll payload as example.

*** ***The generated scripts have been tested on a Samsung device. For other Android brands, there is no guarantee that the payload will work.*** ***	

## Discoveries I Made with Samsung Bluetooth Shortcuts:
- I found that the fastest way to open a YouTube video is to use Android's built-in Google app. By typing in the YouTube link, the Google app automatically opens the YouTube app to play the video (assuming the YouTube app is configured to open default links via settings).
- To open any browser links, it is assumed that the default browser has been configured within the phone's settings. We recommend setting Chrome as the default browser.

Note:
The output payload text file itself should work; any issues, such as technical errors, should be reported by opening an issue with the main BlueDucky repository.
